			Hi! My name is Kevin Ammon Wilde, and welcome to my website! I am a Full-Stack Developer, a student, a husband, a son, and an avid tech geek. Over the course of my life, I have had the opportunity to associate with people from all over the world! These experiences have helped me understand how people think, and more importantly, what they like. As a Developer, I can apply that knowledge and experience into software, websites, and more! You will be able to find examples of this in my projects page. For more information about me personally, visit the "About Me" section. If you would like to discuss my experiences and qualifications with me, go to the "Contact Me" page. I would love to talk with you! Thank you for visiting my site and enjoy!
